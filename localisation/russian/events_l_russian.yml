In the new leadership election, three senior party members are now competing for the top job. The candidates are political veteran Amir Peretz, and young progressives Stav Shaffir and Itzik Shmuli.

yemen.2.t: "Houthi rebels in Yemen prevail in civil war"
yemen.2.d: "After a long and exhausting offensive, the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen have managed to seize control of the nation's second largest city Aden, which had long been the temporary capital of the national government after the fall of Sana'a. Hadi's government was militarily supported by Saudi Arabia, and the Houthi victory in Yemen has shifted the Iran-Saudi power balance dramatically. It is now expected that the Houthis will establish an Iran-like Islamic Republic to rule the country."
yemen.2.o1: "Wow!"
yemen.3.t: "North and South Yemen re-divided after armistice"
yemen.3.d: "In a shocking turn of events, the Yemeni Civil War has ended. Fighting erupted in temporary capital Aden between Saudi-backed government forces and forces loyal to the UAE-backed Southern Movement, a political and military faction dedicated to the re-establishment of the former socialist South Yemen (1967-1990). The separatist forces managed to win the battle, seizing total control over Aden and the surrounding region. Having gained control over the government, the Southern Movement immediately ordered Yemeni troops to cease combat against Houthi rebels in the northern part of the country, and began negotiations for an armistice. The exhausted Houthi forces reluctantly agreed, and Yemen is now once more split between the North and South."
yemen.3.o1: "Again?"
yemen.4.t: "Battle of Aden"
yemen.4.d: "We are under attack! UAE-backed separatists from the Southern Movement, aiming to restore the socialist South Yemen, are attacking Aden in an attempt to overthrow our government! How will this go?"
yemen.4.o1: "The defense is successful."
yemen.4.o2: "The separatists overthrow the government."
yemen.5.t: "Armistice with the South"
yemen.5.d: "After clashes in Aden, separatists from the Southern Movement, aiming to restore the socialist South Yemen, have overthrown the Hadi regime. We then received an offer for an armistice from the separatists. With our position increasingly untenable, accepting the armistice was the only option. With a temporary peace achieved, we are now free to establish an Islamic Republic of Yemen, and prepare to capture Aden once and for all."
yemen.5.o1: "Had to be done."
